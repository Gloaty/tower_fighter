This is going to be a game where you are tasked with ascending a tower, and defeating monsters along the way. I will be creating this game over the next week as of writing. You can keep up with my progress over time with the files I upload, and, if you want to, give feedback and improvements. Thanks! Enjoy the game!  

Alright people, you may be able to tell that this didn't go great. The project was killed a few months ago. I started work on a reamke of the game 'Darkest Dungeon'. I'm working on that now. If you want to, you can keep up with this project, sinstead of the old one. Thanks!
